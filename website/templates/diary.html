        <p class="old-timey-text">Upon my arrival at the Company's offices in Brussels, I was greeted by two ominous women knitting black wool. They led me to a waiting room decorated with a large map with all the colours of the rainbow, each colour representing a different colonial territory. I was then accompanied to the main office of the building for a short meeting with the head of the Company. After signing my contract, one of the women escorted me to a doctor for my physical examination. The doctor measured my skull as he was telling me about the rarity of men who return from Africa. The doctor gloomily said, “the changes take place inside,” and seemed quite interested in learning anything that may give the Belgians the colonial edge. After leaving an uneasy feeling overcame me, but I knew I had now committed to this journey and there is no turning back.</p>

        <h3 class="old-timey-subtitle">The Congo river</h3>
        <h3 class="old-timey-subtitle">May 3, 1892</h3>
        <p class="old-timey-text">It was a silent, eerie night, the boat was surrounded by a thick layer of morning fog. Suddenly, a desolate cry broke the silence, followed by the roar of savage voices. We braced for an attack and the African crewmen remained on alert. The leaders of the cannibals on board notified me that his people were hungry and wanted to eat those who owned the voices from within the fog. Their only source of food had been rotting hippo meat which had been thrown overboard by the pilgrims. About a mile and half from Kurtz's outpost the fog lifted, immediately a barrage of arrows had fallen on the boat. I rushed to get inside the pilothouse for cover, looking out the window I could see that the bushes on the high bank of the river were swarming with natives. The pilgrims below me opened fire with their rifles, creating a cloud of smoke that blocked my sight of the matter. The African helmsman abandoned the wheel to attempt to defend the boat with a one-shot rifle. I grabbed the wheel and steered the boat close to the bank to avoid a dead tree in the river, and as I did so, the helmsman was struck by a spear and fell to my feet. I was able to scare off the attackers by sounding the steam whistle repeatedly. One of the pilgrims enters the pilothouse and was horrified to see the injured helmsman, he died quietly moments later. The incident left the crew shaken as it was quite frightening, but we pressed on towards Kurtz's outpost, knowing the danger would only become more prevalent the closer we came.</p>
